# I started a new attempt at making an engine because
this one was using an 'old' version of vulkan and also I want to rewrite everything without just copying vulkan-tutorial's code and write some things myself. I'll make a repository when some basic renderer's done, hopefully I will do something rather than give up and start working on something else (ah yeah, i've already done that, but it doesn't mean i gave up!)
# bscRND
bscRND (temp name, stands for basic Renderer) is a Vulkan game engine which by far has already ONE GODDAMN TRIANGLE HELL YEAH
## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/griesson-h/bscRND.git; cd bscRND; mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..; make
```
gonna make a better readme when the project will be able to at least render one cube (there used to be written triangle, but i haven't gotten anything interesting to say in readme anyway, so wait for a cube i promise)
