# bscRND
bscRND (temp name, stands for basic Renderer) is a Vulkan game engine which by far has already ONE GODDAMN TRIANGLE HELL YEAH
## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/griesson-h/bscRND.git; cd bscRND; mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..; make
```
gonna make a better readme when the project will able to at least render one cube (there used to be written triangle, but i haven't gotten anything interesting to say in readme anyway, so wait for a cube i promise)
